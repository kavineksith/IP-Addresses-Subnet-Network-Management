# IPv6 Address Management Wizard Documentation

## Overview
The **IPv6 Address Management Wizard** is an advanced Python script for analyzing and managing IPv6 addresses. This tool allows users to convert IPv6 addresses to various formats (hexadecimal, binary, decimal), perform subnet calculations, and determine details about the address space, such as network and broadcast addresses. The script also features screen management and error handling capabilities, providing a comprehensive solution for network administrators and IT professionals working with IPv6.

## Features
- **IPv6 Conversion**: Converts IPv6 addresses to hexadecimal, binary, and decimal formats.
- **Subnet Calculation**: Computes network details including network address, broadcast address, subnet mask, and host mask.
- **Address Validation**: Identifies the type and characteristics of the IPv6 address.
- **Address Range Calculation**: Determines the range of usable host IP addresses within a subnet.
- **Screen Management**: Provides functionality to clear the terminal screen.
- **Formatted Output**: Displays results in a structured, JSON-like format for clarity.

## Dependencies
- **Python 3.x**: The script is compatible with Python 3.x.
- **`ipaddress`**: Used for handling IPv6 address manipulations and subnet calculations.
- **`json`**: Handles JSON formatting for result display.
- **`os`**: Manages system-specific tasks such as clearing the screen.
- **`sys`**: Provides access to system-specific parameters and functions.
- **`time`**: Implements delays and pauses within the script.

## Usage
1. **Running the Script**
   Launch the script using the following command:

   ```
   python ipv6_management_wizard.py
   ```

2. **Interactive Commands**
   - **Enter IPv6 Address and CIDR Notation**: Provide an IPv6 address with CIDR notation in the format `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334/64` for analysis.
   - **Clear Screen**: Type `clear` to clear the terminal screen.
   - **Exit**: Type `exit` to terminate the script and close the application.

3. **Special Commands**
   - **Clear Screen**: Input `clear` to reset the terminal screen.
   - **Exit**: Input `exit` to gracefully stop the script and exit.

## Conclusion
The **IPv6 Address Management Wizard** is a powerful tool for managing and analyzing IPv6 addresses. It provides a range of functionalities including conversion, subnet calculations, and detailed address analysis. With its robust error handling and clear data presentation, it is an invaluable resource for network professionals and educators dealing with IPv6 networks. The script is designed to facilitate easy management and understanding of IPv6 addresses, making it an essential tool for modern network administration.

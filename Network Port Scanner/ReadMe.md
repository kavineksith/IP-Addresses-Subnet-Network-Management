**Port Scanner Documentation**

**Introduction:**

This document provides a comprehensive overview of a Python script designed for network port scanning. The script utilizes the socket library to scan for open and closed ports within a specified range on a given IP address. This tool can be used for network analysis, security auditing, and troubleshooting purposes.

**Script Overview:**

The provided script, named `port_scanner.py`, is a command-line utility that takes three arguments: IP address, start port, and end port. It then scans the specified range of ports on the given IP address and outputs the list of open and closed ports.

**Requirements:**

- Python 3.x
- socket library (included in Python standard library)

**Usage:**

To execute the script, follow the usage pattern below:

```
python port_scanner.py <ip_address> <start_port> <end_port>
```

Where:
- `<ip_address>`: The IP address of the target machine to scan.
- `<start_port>`: The starting port number of the port range to scan.
- `<end_port>`: The ending port number of the port range to scan.

**Example:**

```
python port_scanner.py 192.168.1.100 1 1024
```

**Script Functionality:**

The script performs the following actions:

1. Parses command-line arguments to extract the IP address, start port, and end port.
2. Creates an instance of the `PortScanner` class with the provided arguments.
3. Initiates a port scanning process using the `scan_ports()` method of the `PortScanner` class.
4. Checks each port in the specified range for openness using the `socket` library.
5. Stores the results (open and closed ports) in separate lists.
6. Prints the list of open and closed ports using the `print_results()` method of the `PortScanner` class.

**PortScanner Class:**

The `PortScanner` class encapsulates the functionality required for port scanning. It includes the following attributes and methods:

- **Attributes:**
  - `ip_address`: IP address of the target machine.
  - `start_port`: Starting port number of the port range.
  - `end_port`: Ending port number of the port range.
  - `open_ports`: List to store open ports.
  - `closed_ports`: List to store closed ports.

- **Methods:**
  - `__init__(self, ip_address, start_port, end_port)`: Initializes the PortScanner object with the provided IP address, start port, and end port.
  - `scan_ports(self)`: Scans the ports within the specified range and populates the `open_ports` and `closed_ports` lists accordingly.
  - `print_results(self)`: Prints the lists of open and closed ports.

**Conclusion:**
The `port_scanner.py` script provides a simple yet effective solution for network port scanning tasks. By leveraging Python's socket library, it enables users to identify open and closed ports on a target machine within a specified port range. This tool can be utilized by network administrators, security professionals, and system analysts to assess network security and diagnose connectivity issues.
